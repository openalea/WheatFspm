    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    Model of respiration based on Thornley and Cannell, 2000.
    The model computes the respiration associated with the main biological processes.

    R_total = sum(R_growth) + R_phloem + R_Namm_upt + R_Nnit_upt + R_Nnit_red(shoot + root) + R_N2fix + R_min_upt + sum(R_residual)
