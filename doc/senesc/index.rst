Module description
==================

.. topic:: Overview

    Senesc-Wheat is a model of plant senescence adapted to wheat. Leaf senescence is regulated by
    the N status of each leaf. After the death of a tissue, the model also calculates the remobilisation
    of C and N metabolites towards the living tissues of the organ.
    Root senescence is assumed to occur only after floral transition.
