Module description
==================

.. topic:: Overview

    Elong-Wheat is a model of leaf elongation. Individual leaves are represented by a hiddenzone
    compartment (encompassing all growing and mature tissues of the growing leaves located inside the pseudostem) and
    any exposed tissues of the growing leaves. The rates of leaf elongation are regulated by
    the C-N concentration in the hiddenzone and coordinations rules between successive leaves.
