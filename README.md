# WheatFspm
WheatFspm is a Functional Structural Plant Model (FSPM) of wheat which fully integrates shoot morphogenesis and the metabolism of carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) at organ scale within a 3D representation of plant architecture. Plants are described as a collection of tillers, each consisting in individual shoot organs (lamina, sheath, internode, peduncle, chaff), a single root compartment, the grains, and a phloem.

WheatFspm simulates:
* Organ photosynthesis, temperature and transpiration from light distribution within the 3D canopy which is provided by Caribu and Adel-Wheat models ((Chelle and Andrieu, 1998) ; (Fournier *et al.*, 2003), respectively)
* Leaf and internode elongation
* Leaf, internode and root growth in mass
* N acquisition, synthesis and allocation of C and N metabolites at organ level and among tiller organs
* Senescence of shoot organs and roots

Model inputs are the climatic conditions (temperature, light, humidity, CO2, wind, soil NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>) and initial dimensions, mass and metabolic composition of individual organs.

# Description
WheatFspm consists in a set of sub-models (named submodules in git) which share inputs/outputs through an MTG object:

*Adapted from Gauthier et al. (2020)*

* *Farquhar-Wheat*: Farquhar-based model of photosynthesis, stomatal conductance, organ temperature and transpiration.
* *Elong-Wheat*: regulation of leaf and internode elongation by C and N metabolites, temperature and coordination rules.
* *Growth-Wheat*: growth in biomass of leaves, internodes and roots ; related consumption in C and N metabolites.
* *CN-Wheat*: synthesis and degradation of C and N metabolites at organ level and allocation between tillers' organs. See doc at https://cn-wheat.readthedocs.io/ 
* *Respi-Wheat*: respiratory-costs related to the main biological processes.
* *Senesc-Wheat*: organ senescence and consequences in organ biomass, green area and remoblisation of C and N metabolites.
* *Fspm-Wheat*: is the submodule containing the interfaces (facades) for reading/updating information between each sub-model and the MTG. Also includes the scripts to be run for using all sub-models.

# Usage

To date, *WheatFspm* has been used in four main contexts described below. 

The scripts to run *WheatFSPM* are located in:
* `WheatFspm\fspm-wheat\example\NEMA`
* `WheatFspm\fspm-wheat\example\Papier_FSPMA2016`
* `WheatFspm\fspm-wheat\example\Vegetative_stages`
* `WheatFspm\fspm-wheat\example\Scenarii_monoculms`

## NEMA
This example deals with the post-flowering stages of wheat developement under 3 nitrogen fertilisation regies (H0, H3 and H15). The main processes described are leaf senescence, C and N remobilisation, grain filling). During that stages, all vegetative organs have completed their growth. 
This work led to the research articles [Barillot *et al.* (2016a)](https://doi.org/10.1093/aob/mcw143) and [Barillot *et al.* (2016b)](https://doi.org/10.1093/aob/mcw144).
This example has been maintained in the current version ; results of above papers were generated using the tag *release-1.0* of *CN-Wheat*. 

To run the example:
* Open a command line interpreter in `WheatFspm\fspm-wheat\example\NEMA`
* Run each script called *main.py* located in *NEMA_H0*, *NEMA_H3*, *NEMA_H15*: `python main.py`

## Papier_FSPMA2016
This example deals with the effects of leaf inclination, radiations regimes, plant density and sowing patterns on plant metabolism and grain filling during the post-flowering stages.   
This work led to the research article [Barillot *et al.* (2019)](https://doi.org/10.1093/aob/mcy208).
The scripts have not been maintained in the current version but are available using tags *paper_FSPMA16* or each submodule listed in [Description](#description).

To run the example:
* Open a command line interpreter in `WheatFspm\fspm-wheat\example\Papier_FSPMA2016`
* Run each script called *main.py* located in the different sub-directories: `python main.py`

## Vegetative stages
This example deals with the early vegetative stages of wheat development. It mainly covers the processes of leaf, internode and roots growth.
Tillering is simplified: tiller emergence is a model input while tiller metabolism and growth is approximated from that  of the main stem.
This work led to the research article [Gauthier *et al.* (2020)](https://doi.org/10.1093/jxb/eraa276). Results were obtained from the tag [paper_JXBot_2020](https://github.com/openalea-incubator/WheatFspm/releases/tag/paper_JXBot_2020).
To run the model used for the paper, please download the code archives at [![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.3759714.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3759714)
 
To run the example:
* Open a command line interpreter in `WheatFspm\fspm-wheat\example\Vegetative_stages`
* Run script *main.py*: `python main.py`

## Scenarios_monoculms
This example deals with the plasticity of leaf growth during the vegetative stages of wheat development. The growth of wheat monoculms was simulated for highly contrasting conditions of soil nitrogen concentration, incident light and planting density.
This work led to the research article [Gauthier *et al.* (2021)](https://doi.org/10.1093/insilicoplants/diab034). Results were obtained from the following sources: [cn-wheat](https://github.com/openalea-incubator/cn-wheat/releases/tag/v2.0), [elong-wheat](https://github.com/openalea-incubator/elong-wheat/releases/tag/v3.0), [growth-wheat](https://github.com/openalea-incubator/growth-wheat/releases/tag/v2.0), [farquhar-wheat](https://github.com/openalea-incubator/farquhar-wheat/releases/tag/v2.0), [senesc-wheat](https://github.com/openalea-incubator/senesc-wheat/releases/tag/2.0), [respi-wheat](https://github.com/openalea-incubator/respi-wheat/releases/tag/v2.0) and [fspmwheat-wheat](https://github.com/openalea-incubator/fspm-wheat/releases/tag/release-2.0).

To run the example:
* Open a command line interpreter in `WheatFspm\fspm-wheat\example\Scenarios_monoculms`
